Furls’ owner and C-Suite members have either marched for, protested against discrimination, or donated personally to LGBTQ positive organizations. Supporting the community has been a mission of the heart. And with internal discussions, including talks about wanting to be true and authentic, we decided to release a Pride hook.<\/p>\n<p>The pride hook is about celebrating wins, giving visibility and recognition. It’s about showing everyone in the crochet community that queer folx are here, proud, and an integral part of this space.\n<\/p>\n<p>We put in the work at Furls to create a space where queer people can be their authentic selves. We have a zero discrimination policy. We have equal pay and opportunity for all. We are proud of our LGBTQ individuals in our company and in our community. And we want you to wear that Pride out loud.\n<\/p>"
